# Privacy Policy — Job Application Tracker

## Data the extension stores
The extension stores the job application entries you create (job title, company, location, status, URL, notes, and optional follow-up date) in **Chrome local extension storage** (`chrome.storage.local`) on your device.

## Data the extension collects
- The extension reads the current page content to detect job title/company/location when you press **Detect**.
- If you enable **AI extraction**, the extension sends a limited text snapshot of the page (up to ~20k characters) to your configured AI endpoint.

## Data sharing
- **Default mode:** No data leaves your device.
- **AI mode (optional):** Data is sent only to the endpoint you configure (your Cloudflare Worker). That backend may send data to an AI provider (OpenAI) depending on how you deployed it.

## Data deletion
You can delete individual entries using the **Delete** button. Removing the extension clears local data.
